Cache Simulator for educational purposes.

## Current State

Lacking alot of functionalities still

## Future Developments

Possibilites to simulate cache behaviour by specifying a program in assembly, and possibly using both I and D-caches for the simulation.

```bash
# Start for development
$ npm start 

# Build with webpack on watch
$ npm run build

# Run unit tests
$ npm test

# Lint all files in src (also automatically done AFTER tests are run)
$ npm run lint


```
